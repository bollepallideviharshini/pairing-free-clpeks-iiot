Pairing-Free Certificateless Searchable Public Key Encryption (CLPEKS) Scheme for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
# Pairing-Free CLPEKS Scheme for IIoT

## 📌 Overview
This project proposes a pairing-free Certificateless Public Key Authenticated Encryption with Keyword Search (CLPEKS) scheme for secure data storage in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

The scheme eliminates bilinear pairing to reduce computational cost and resists Inside Keyword Guessing Attacks (IKGA).
